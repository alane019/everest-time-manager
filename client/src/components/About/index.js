        Establishing daily goals in a visible format is scientifically proven to
        provide an enhanced focus that leads to increased productivity (and
        likely increased earnings!). In 1979, researchers at "The Harvard MBA
        Business School" conducted a study highlighting the importance of goal
        setting. Furthermore, writing down those desired goals is essential to
        the likelihood of achieving your goals.
